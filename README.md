# botnet

Note this project turned into a larger project that will not be on github quite yet, so you won't see any more commits to this repo. However it is still a good reference for the time being so I'll leave it on here.

A persistent and stealthy botnet using several methods of beaconing.

	The client to install

2. master.py
	The command and control center for the botnet

3. data_types.py
	Contains datatypes sent between the bot and master, as well as SQL objects
